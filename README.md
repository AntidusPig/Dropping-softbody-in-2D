# Dropping-softbody-in-2D
self-study project
I am always enthusiastic about the computer simulated world of Physics. Lately I am trying to simulate the deformation of a soft body in collision with a rigid body, in two dimension. The programme is still incomplete, but now I leave it here and after a while I will come back to it.
